## AES and RSA Encryption using C

DSA 2016-17

MIS:111508053

Name:Tejas Uday Nayak

## Features

### AES:

Symmetric Key Algorithm

FIPS PUB 197: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Padding done using PKCS#7 Standard

Sample keys corresponding to each size(128 / 192 / 256) included for quick demo

Can encrypt even large files in quick time

Used matrices as the prime data structure for implementation

### RSA:

1024 bit RSA cryptosystem

Created new data type for multiple precision integers using linked lists

Used gmp library for quick modular exponentiation and prime no generation

Being a slow algorithm RSA is not primarily used for file encryption but for securing symmetric keys


## Usage

```
$ make
$ ./project [-da | -ea | -dr | -er] <source> <destination> <keyfile> <keysize(for aes only)>
```
